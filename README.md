# LuhnCheckSumValidation


<h2>The Luhn formula is a widely used system for validating ID numbers.
Using the original number, double the value of every other digit. 
Then add all the values of the individual digits together (if a doubled
value now has two digits, add the digits individually). The ID number
is valid if the sum is divisible by 10.</h2>
